# Managing your code with Git

Starting this year, we will use a slightly different workflow for managing our code with Git.  Instead of everyone contributing to the same repository, each team member will "fork" the main repository (streppneumo/isp) and commit to their local copy.

You will be responsible for keeping your fork up to date (syncing) and letting Paul know when you have changes that are ready for incorporation into the main repository (pull requesting).

To setup your new fork:

1. Delete the old isp directory from your computer.  If you have any unsynced changes, let Paul know.  You will not be able to push changes to the streppneumo/isp repository anymore.  (Your write permissions have been removed.)

2. Follow the instructions on [https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) to fork the streppneumo/isp repository into your GitHub account.
