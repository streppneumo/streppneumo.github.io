# Project Ideas

1.  Expression machinery (Corey & Ryan)
	- Identify all tRNA and tRNA synthetase genes.
	- Identify RNA polymerases and their regulators.
	- Define the ribosome assembly complex and assembly factors.
	- Create functions to generate RNA and protein synthesis reactions from a genome.
	- Collect expression parameters ($$k_{\mathrm{cat}}$$, etc.)

2.  Transporter comparison between TIGR4, D39, and 19F (Wendy)
	- Curate all know and predicted ABC transporters.
	- Identify differences between strains.
	- Assemble evidence for metabolites with passive transport.

3.  Amino acid metabolism (Karen)
	- Refine curation of amino acid pathways.
	- Identify strain-specific differences in catabolism and anabolism.
	- Construct a TRN for amino acid metabolism.
	- Compare model predictions with growth experiments.

5.  Signal transduction and two-component systems (Sandra, Amanda)
	- Curate known signaling pathways.
	- Define agonists, antagonists, and interventions with the TRN.
	- Define factors affecting signaling dynamics (pH, scaffolds, etc.)

6.  TRN reconstruction (Emma, Margaret)
	- Identify TF/motif pairs.
	- Create regulatory rules for known TFs.
	- Generate putitive rules of predicted TFs.

8.  Secondary metabolism (Derek, Steve)
	- Curate synthesis of pathways for vitamin and cofactor metabolism.
	- Define links between nucleotide/nucleoside metabolism and energetics.
	- Predict minimal media compositions and essential nutrients.

4.  Cell cycle and mechanobiology
	- Identify genes involved in DNA repair, replication, and maintenance.
	- Create a logical "checklist" for entry into replication.
	- Describe function of proteins involved in cell mechanics.

7.  Virulence factors and surface proteins
	- Identify genes involve in infection, serotype, and interactions with immune system.
